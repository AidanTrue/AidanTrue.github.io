    <h2>The Climate Emergency</h2>
    <h3>Sustainable Energy Transition: Which countries are leading the transition to renewables?</h3>
    <h5>The aim of this project is to highlight the climate emergency, and see who are the main leaders in building a more sustainable future.</h5>

    <p>This project will focus on Carbon Dioxide (CO2) as the key greenhouse gas to analyse, as the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that Carbon Dioxide accounts for roughly 70% of greenhouse gas emissions. Fossil fuel use is the primary source of CO2, but CO2 can also be emitted from direct human-induced impacts, such as through deforestation, land clearing for agriculture, and degradation of soils. Due to the primary source of CO2 being fossil fuels, and the primary use of fossil fuels being energy production, this project will also look at renewable energy production & investment.</p>

    <h5>“The vast preponderance of evidence, based on years of research conducted by a wide array of different investigators at many institutions, clearly indicates that global climate change is real, it is caused largely by human activities, and the need to take action is urgent”</h5>

<p>This first graph highlights why the climate emergency is just that: an emergency. The data shows 800,000 years of atmospheric CO2 history, with peaks during the warm periods (interglacial), and troughs during ice-ages (glacial periods). Prior to recent years, the maximum atmospheric CO2 concentration was around 300ppmv. In 1912, that boundary was broken, and from this data, the most recent measure in 2001 puts the atmospheric CO2 at 368 ppmv, a clear and worrying anomaly when compared to our historical data. In fact, based on preliminary analysis by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(NOAA), the global average atmospheric carbon dioxide in 2020 was 412.5 parts per million, the highest ever recorded.</p>

<p>This graph shows the scatter plot of CO2 emissions per capita against renewable energy as a percentage of total electricity output from renewables in 2020. The graph also calculates the R-Squared value of the data, and returns us a value of 0.20. Whilst this may not seem very high, for real-world data it is quite significant - The regression model accounts for 20% of the variance in our data! This supports our initial claim that fossil fuel usage for energy is directly linked to CO2 output.</p>
