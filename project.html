    <h2>The Climate Emergency</h2>
    <h3>Sustainable Energy Transition: Which countries are leading the transition to renewables?</h3>

    <h6>“The vast preponderance of evidence, based on years of research conducted by a wide array of different investigators at many institutions, clearly indicates that global climate change is real, it is caused largely by human activities, and the need to take action is urgent”</h6>
    <p>~Alan I. Leshner, chief executive officer of The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)</p>

<p>This first graph highlights why the climate emergency is just that: an emergency. The data shows 800,000 years of atmospheric CO2 history, with peaks during the warm periods (interglacial), and troughs during ice-ages (glacial periods). Prior to recent years, the maximum atmospheric CO2 concentration was around 300ppmv. In 1912, that boundary was broken, and from this data, the most recent measure in 2001 puts the atmospheric CO2 at 368 ppmv, a clear and worrying anomaly when compared to our historical data. In fact, based on preliminary analysis by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(NOAA), the global average atmospheric carbon dioxide in 2020 was 412.5 parts per million, the highest ever recorded.</p>
