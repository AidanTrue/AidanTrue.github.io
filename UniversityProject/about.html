<h3>About me</h3>
<h6>My name is Aidan True, and I am a third year Economics student at the University of Bristol. Prior to this academic year I had very little 
    experience in coding, having only touched upon the coding language "R" in my first year at university. This module has taught me a vast 
    range of new coding languages - such as HTML, Javascript and Python - as well as developing my skills as a data scientist, through 
    skills such as cleaning data and accessing online APIs</h6>

<h3>About the project</h3>
<h6>For the assessment of my Data Science module, I have compiled this portfolio of code and data to showcase and test my new coding skills, 
    as well as investigating a topic of my choosing in the Project page. For my project, I have decided to explore the climate emergency. As
    young person, the future of our planet is something of great concern to me, and I would like to analyse the data available to help me 
    understand the situation better</h6>

<h3>About the portfolio</h3>
<h6>This course aims for students to complete 10 tasks, found in the portfolio section, that demonstrate an understanding of key Data Science skills.
    The skills are:
<h6 style="text-align:left;">1. Building a site - Build your multi-page site. Host it on GitHub, with at least two pages: index (your portfolio) and project.</h6>
<h6 style="text-align:left;">2. Embedding - Embed three charts, two that are given to you in class. One (as homework) taken from the repository of charts that drive www.rapidcharts.io</h6>
<h6 style="text-align:left;">3. Hosting data - Embed two charts of your own design: (a) from a given API, (b) from the same/related data saved to your GitHub.</h6>
<h6 style="text-align:left;">4. Editing data, writing JSON by hand - Two more charts. One where you change the data (add an observation, add a series, create a new series); One where the data is “in-line” JSON that you write. This second chart need only have 5 or so observations.</h6>
<h6 style="text-align:left;">5. API driven charts - Embed two charts of your own design from two separate APIs that you sign up for & gain access to.</h6>
<h6 style="text-align:left;">6. Loops and APIs - Download code from an API using fetch in Python/Colab and chart this. Use a loop to batch download data.</h6>
<h6 style="text-align:left;">7. Loops and scrapers - Build a scraper in Colab, save and chart the results.</h6>
<h6 style="text-align:left;">8. Data Stories - Attend one (or more) mornings of Talking Economics. After this construct a chart that would (a) support or (b) refute an argument that is made there.</h6>
<h6 style="text-align:left;">9. Advanced analytics - Build a chart with data from two separate sources. Plot these data using correlation, regression or some other technique. Build  and embed a chart that uses advanced statistical methods, testing causality or distribution.</h6>
<h6 style="text-align:left;">10. Interactivity - Build and embed two interactive charts.</h6>
