<h3>About me</h3>
<p>My name is Aidan True, and I am a third year Economics student at the University of Bristol. Prior to this academic year I had very little 
    experience in coding, having only touched upon the coding language "R" in my first year at university. This module has taught me a vast 
    range of new coding languages - such as HTML, Javascript and Python - as well as developing my skills as a data scientist, through 
    skills such as cleaning data and accessing online APIs</p>

<h3>About the project</h3>
<p>For the assessment of my Data Science module, I have compiled this portfolio of code and data to showcase and test my new coding skills, 
    as well as investigating a topic of my choosing in the Project page</p>
